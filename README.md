# Does the Home Run Derby Affect a Batter's Swing?

There has been plenty of discourse among baseball writers whether or not participating in the Home Run Derby harms a batter's swing, with many recent arguments against the existence of a "Home Run Derby curse." This project analyzes the batting performances of the eight participants of the 2024 Home Run Derby between season halves by creating a novel Statcast-like metric, the Post-Break Performance Index (PBPI), and visualizing trends in each batter's at-bat outcomes, plate discipline, and swing kinematics. Included in this repository are the Jupyter notebook and slides containing results and sample visualizations.

Batters analyzed:
- **Pete Alonso,** New York Mets
- **Alec Bohm,** Philadelphia Phillies
- **Adolis Garcia,** Texas Rangers
- **Gunnar Henderson,** Baltimore Orioles
- **Teoscar Hernandez,** Los Angeles Dodgers
- **Marcell Ozuna,** Atlanta Braves
- **Jose Ramirez,** Cleveland Guardians
- **Bobby Witt Jr.,** Kansas City Royals
